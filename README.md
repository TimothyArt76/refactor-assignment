Title
Using Semantic HTML and CSS Classes to Create Cleaner, More Legible Code. 

Date 6-17-2021

Getting Started
    First create a repository in github. After checking what directory is open in gitbash, clone the repository to local computer. Install assets and index file, as well as ReadMe file from gitlab. Modified files were pushed to github, asfter using the git status, git add ., and git commit comands. 

    First, all div tags were modified to semantic html tags. These tags defined the header and navigation elements at the top, article and section tags. The title tag was changed to Horiseon. Alt elements were added to images, to assure accessability.  
    There was a lot of redundancy within the css. Too many classes were created, and they were adding the same styling to elements that could have been grouped into the same class. This required altering class names in the html and applying a new general class to multiple elements. This made the code less cluttered. 
    I created a new class for sections called "sectionclass" to define what was previously defines by three different classes. Then I was able to combine "sectionclass" with the img element as well as the h2 element.  
Prerequisits
    Doing prework, attending class and doing independent research were the only prerequisits.
Installing
    The following files were installed and modified: assets, index and ReadMe. They were cloned to the local computer using gitbash and worked on in Visual Studio Code.
